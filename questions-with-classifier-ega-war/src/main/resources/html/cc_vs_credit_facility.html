<p>The credit card offers you a credit limit that remains in place for an extended period as opposed to the maximum term of 6 months for a credit facility. The maximum limit for a credit card is also much higher than the maximum of R5000 for the credit facility. Your monthly repayment structure also differs on a credit card as you can opt to pay the minimum payment of 5% of the outstanding balance compared to the full outstanding amount of the credit facility.The credit facility is accessed by transferring the required amount to your Capitec Bank savings account while access to your credit card account is obtained via your credit card.</p>
