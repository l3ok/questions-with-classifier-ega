<p>We will not debit your account if the minimum payment due is less than R25.00 due to the associated cost of a debit order. The payment due will be carried over and debited to your account the following month. You will not be deemed to be in arrears in this instance but interest will still be calculated and debited to your account. To avoid this you can make a payment via an EFT or deposit cash at a branch)</p>
