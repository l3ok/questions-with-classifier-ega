<p>You can see your spending on your free monthly statement. You may also use our Remote Banking (Internet or App), certain Capitec Bank ATMs or visit a branch to view or print your statement or transaction history. We will also send you a transaction notification SMS for purchases exceeding R100 (or your own chosen limit) as soon as we authorise the transaction if you are registered for SMS update. The SMS costs 40c per notification.</p>
