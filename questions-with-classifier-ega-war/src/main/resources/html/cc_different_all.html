<p>The credit card offers you a revolving credit limit that remains in place for an extended period as opposed to a fixed term for a term loan. It allows you to pay a percentage of the outstanding balance or the full outstanding balance each month. As the outstanding balance is paid off, it becomes available again. You can use the credit card as and when you need it without having to apply for a loan every time. The maximum limit for a credit card is lower than the maximum for a term loan.</p>
