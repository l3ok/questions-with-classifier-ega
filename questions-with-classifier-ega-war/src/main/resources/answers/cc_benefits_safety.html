<p>Capitec credit card safety: Using a credit card is safer than cash as it cannot be used when lost or stolen. Your Capitec Bank credit card is equipped with the latest Chip & PIN technology. Never share your PIN with anyone. To protect you from possible fraudulent attempts, your card will be locked after a number of attempts to prevent the use of the card with an incorrect PIN. A credit card also offers you more protection as you may in some instances be able to have payments reversed if services were not rendered or goods not delivered. MasterCard SecureCode will further protect you while shopping online.</p>
