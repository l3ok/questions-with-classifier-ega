<p>Our aim is to provide our customers with the best in entertainment, at affordable prices. To make our service cost effective, we bundle DStv channels into packages so we can spread the costs across these. If we could offer customisable packages, your choice might not prove very popular so the expense would be spread across far fewer customers, thereby making it far more expensive.</p>
