<p>The extended catalogue available when you connect your DStv Explora to the internet is updated via the internet, whereas the DStv Catch Up that is delivered to your DStv Explora goes via satellite. This means that content might arrive sooner on the online catalogue than the DStv Catch Up service on your decoder. For a list of which shows are available on DStv Catch Up on your decoder or on the extended catalogue online, please go to Schedules on DStv.com.</p>
