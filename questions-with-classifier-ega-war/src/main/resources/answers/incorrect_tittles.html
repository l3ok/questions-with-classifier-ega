<p>When a customer rents a movie on boxoffice using their cellphone and gets an incorrect movie the same movie is then re-entitled for the customer at no cost and if that fails trouble shooting is done to check if signal strength an quality are ok on the decoder.</p><p>
Normal troubleshooting should be followed (for example):
<p>Go to vod status with dstv remote by (pressing help= general information= information central= decoder=vod status if it says not available you exit all the way out) and go to (settings= user preferences= general= then set maintenance time = set time to 5 minutes ahead and  save all changes exit all the way out) and press and hold rest\power button on the front panel of the decoder till decoder switches off if all that fails  the last resort is to reset and format hardrive  by going to (settings= system settings= reset decoder settings= reset and format hardrive) then wait for decoder to reset and resume by following installation wizard</p>
<li>Check signal strength and quality </li>
<li>Check software status is up to date</li>
<li>Click on view my balance</li>
<p> It is likely that the decoder lost a setting when first being set up. If your DStv Explora has any personalised settings (including Network settings or ones for XtraView), please make sure you take down those settings and then follow these steps : </p>
<li> Press the BLUE DStv button</li>
<li> Go to Settings</li>
<li> Select System Settings</li>
<li> Select Reset Decoder Settings</li>
<li> Select Reset to Factory Default AND format hard drive (this will delete all recordings, all scheduled recordings, as well as BoxOffice movies).</li>
<li> Please do not switch the decoder off for at least 15 minutes after this process has completed (this includes no reboots). </li>
<li> Please reenter any personalised settings and then check again after 6-12 hours and let us know if there are still NO DStv Catch Up titles </li>
<li>Additionally, check the latest schedule IS20 template for box office and catch up </li>
<li>Escalation process </li>
<li>Fill the box office template</li>
<li>Escalate to team leader to forward to business desk (box office) </li>
</ul>
