<p>Yes you can but it's important for you to note that if your decoder is an older model which is at the end of its lifecycle, we cannot fix or replace it with the same model decoder if it breaks. You cannot take out insurance on this decoder. We also no longer do software upgrades for this decoder. If you are you still comfortable to proceed with the activation then you can go ahead.</p>
