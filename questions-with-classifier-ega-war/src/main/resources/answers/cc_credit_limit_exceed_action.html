<p>We will carefully monitor your spending and transactions exceeding your credit limit will be declined. We may (as allowed in terms of the NCA) allow you to temporarily exceed your limit, but you will still remain liable for all outstanding amounts. If you have exceeded your credit limit you have to repay this immediately. Your credit bureau profile may also be updated when you exceed your limit, which will result in a negative effect on your credit record. Any over limit amounts will be added to the amount you have to repay the next month.</p>
