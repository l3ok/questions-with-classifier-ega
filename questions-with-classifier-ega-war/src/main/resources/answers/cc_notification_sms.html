<p>We will only send you a SMS for transactions of more than R100. Transactions below R100 are not deemed high risk and would not justify the cost of notification. Some transactions above R100 might be processed at a later stage, resulting in a delayed SMS which will be sent when we receive and process the transaction.</p>
