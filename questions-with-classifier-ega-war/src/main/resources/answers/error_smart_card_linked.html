<p>This error occurs when change of ownership has happened and the smartcard is still linked to the previous owner's profile. To resolve this, the previous owner needs to ensure that the device being sold is unlinked from their online profile. The new owner needs to ensure that the device has been removed from the previous online profile. If the previous owner cannot be contacted then please escalate your query to dstv@support.dstv.com.</p>
